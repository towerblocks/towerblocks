# tower-blocks

A tower building game written in C#

## Gameplay:

- The goal is to stack as many tower blocks on top of each other as you can!
- You have to drop them on each other while the one you're dropping is moving left-right, making it difficult to line them up.
- If a part of it isn't lined up well, the parts hanging off will be cut, making the game harder as it progresses.
